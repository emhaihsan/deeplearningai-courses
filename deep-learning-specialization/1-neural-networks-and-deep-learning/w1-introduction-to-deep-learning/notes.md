### What is Neural Network?

- Deep Learning refers to training Neural Networks, which can be very large.
- A Neural Network is a model used for various tasks; here, the example is Housing Price Prediction.
- Linear regression is initially used to predict house prices based on size, but adjustments are made to ensure realistic predictions.
- A basic neural network is illustrated with a single neuron, taking the size of the house as input and predicting the price as output.
- The neuron uses a ReLU (rectified linear unit) function, common in neural network literature.
- Larger neural networks are formed by stacking multiple neurons together, creating a more complex model.
- Additional features like number of bedrooms, family size, zip code, and wealth are introduced to enhance predictions.
- These features are processed by individual neurons, contributing to the overall prediction of house prices.
- The neural network has an input layer (with features) and hidden layers that are densely connected.
- Neural networks, given enough training data, can learn to accurately map inputs to outputs.
- The focus is on supervised learning, where the network learns to map input $(x)$ to output $(y)$.
