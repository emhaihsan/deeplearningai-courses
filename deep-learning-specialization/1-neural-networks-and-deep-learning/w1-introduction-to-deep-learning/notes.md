### What is Neural Network?

- Deep Learning refers to training Neural Networks, which can be very large.
- A Neural Network is a model used for various tasks; here, the example is Housing Price Prediction.
- Linear regression is initially used to predict house prices based on size, but adjustments are made to ensure realistic predictions.
- A basic neural network is illustrated with a single neuron, taking the size of the house as input and predicting the price as output.
- The neuron uses a ReLU (rectified linear unit) function, common in neural network literature.
- Larger neural networks are formed by stacking multiple neurons together, creating a more complex model.
- Additional features like number of bedrooms, family size, zip code, and wealth are introduced to enhance predictions.
- These features are processed by individual neurons, contributing to the overall prediction of house prices.
- The neural network has an input layer (with features) and hidden layers that are densely connected.
- Neural networks, given enough training data, can learn to accurately map inputs to outputs.
- The focus is on supervised learning, where the network learns to map input $(x)$ to output $(y)$.

### Supervised Learning with Neural Network

- **Introduction to Neural Networks:**
  - Hype surrounding neural networks and their effectiveness.
  - Emphasis on economic value from supervised learning.

- **Supervised Learning Basics:**
  - Definition of supervised learning: input x, output y.
  - Examples include housing price prediction and online advertising.

- **Applications of Neural Networks:**
  - Online advertising as a lucrative application.
  - Advances in computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, and autonomous driving.

- **Neural Network Architectures:**
  - Different architectures for various applications.
  - Standard neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNN), and recurrent neural networks (RNN).

  - Structured data involves well-defined features (e.g., housing data).
  - Unstructured data includes audio, images, and text; improved interpretation by neural networks.

- **Economic Value of Neural Networks:**
  - Short-term economic value in structured data (e.g., advertising systems).
  - Recognition of neural network successes in unstructured data.
